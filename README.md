# Notionish

A Notion(ish) attempt at building a second brain app. Or, parts of a second brain app.

Google says that the web version of Notion is built in ElectronJS, but I really wanted to get some practice in at using TypeScript in React, which is what I'll be building this in. Figured TypeScript would be helpful at keeping all the moving-parts straight as I'm going, and it was an excuse to play with it some more, so! That's what we're doing.

## Log

- Wrote up this README.
- Initialised CRA with TypeScript template flag.
- Tidied up boilerplate.
