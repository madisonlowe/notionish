/* **Editable header zone:**
- Editable icon field. WORKING ON THIS NOW.
    - You click the icon.
    - A menu of other emoji icons comes up.
    - You select from the icons.
    - The icon is set as the icon in the header, and the icon in the metadata.
    - There's a lot more functionality, and you can set images, but I can worry about this later.
    So, recreating:
        - You click on the icon.
        - A menu comes up.
        - Menu contains a dictionary of icons that you can select and use.
        - On click, the selected icon is set as state for the main icon.
        - This state should also be used to set the metadata of the EditablePage, so will need to be raised later?
- Editable cover field.
    - Only editable through clicking on various buttons.
Can manage this state through just this component? Maybe? I think? Nothing else on the wider page is able to affect it, and it's always visible on the page, so don't need state any higher?
TODO:
- Fix the onChange, so that it takes in different parameters, and can change states a few different ways.
- Going to have to make a component for the pop up menu for emojis.

I AM CURRENTLY TRYING TO HAND IN PROPS OF STATE TO THE SPAN SO THAT I CAN MAKE THE POP UP APPEAR AND SET THE SETICONHEADER STATE.
